# One thing a day

Have you ever watched a news video or read a news article, and wondered what you could do about it? Or, have you decided to tune out all the noise from the political scene to (very understandably) protect your own mental health and sanity?

Introducting: One thing a day.

Each day, a rundown of one news article will be posted, with the focus of having potential action items the end. Pick one, pick more, but stay knowledgeable and play an active role in bettering your community, state, country, and world. Just do one action each day to work towards a better future.

We can do more and go farther by working together.

Current topics are centered around the United States' political scene and many of the current administration's actions, but future topics will span from environmental to healthcare, to science to history. Stay tuned for "Monday Fundays" where more positive and goodness-packed articles will be shared.
