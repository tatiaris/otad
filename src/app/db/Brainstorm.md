## Taking Action: Impact of your Action
### Statistics
<ul>
  <li> Impact % of a certain action</li>
    <li>Ex: "Statistics show xx% of changing things"</li>
    <li>Ex2: "A similar movement for environmental issues had xxx people and successfully pushed their narrative"</li>
  <li>Button for "I did this" which tracks clicks of people who actually took the action</li>
</ul>

## Crowdsourcing: Finding what issues the public is most interested in learning about or sharing
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>Voting System for Articles/Issues - Public can vote on select articles. Then Admins verify the quality of the top rated article and schedule that for release the following day</li>
  <li>Voting System for Actions - Readers can vote on different actions and share their knowledge/expertise on improving the action</li>
</ul>

## Formatting the article or website itself
<ul> 
<li>Simplifying the articles - Making articles easy to consume (example, short, simple languaging) and take immediate action</li>
</ul>

## Questions/Convo's for other Admins
<ul>
  <li>Erica: How to balance the language of the breaking down of the articles? I want to have formal enough language to accomodate readers of all types, but also want to make it understood by people of different education levels (ex: using "cancel" instead of "rescind")</li>
</ul>
