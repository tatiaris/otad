<h2>What Happened?</h2>
<p>UNICEF has been instrumental in preventing the collapse of Afghanistan’s healthcare system, covering two-thirds of the sector since 2021. They have employed 28,000 full-time healthcare workers and 32,000 volunteers to support 96 hospitals and 2,400 rural clinics. The program has enabled 2.2 million births in their facilities, a 20% increase since 2019.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Afghanistan’s healthcare system was on the brink of collapse, primarily due to the loss of international funding after the Taliban took control in August 2021, leaving millions without access to medical care. UNICEF’s efforts have provided critical services like childbirth support, vaccinations, and malnutrition prevention, particularly in rural and hard-to-reach areas. These services save lives and introduce modern medicine to communities that previously had little access to healthcare.</p>

<h2>Who It Affects?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Afghan Families:</strong> Particularly those in rural areas who rely on these facilities for childbirth, vaccinations, and general healthcare.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare Workers & Volunteers:</strong> The 60,000+ people employed in providing these lifesaving services.</li>
    <li><strong>Women & Children:</strong> The primary recipients of hospital-level care under UNICEF’s program who have limited access to healthcare otherwise, due to Taliban imposed restrictions.</li>
  <li><strong>People Worldwide:</strong> Aside from ethical obligations, infectious diseases don’t recognize borders. Supporting healthcare worldwide helps prevent outbreaks that could become global pandemics, protecting everyone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Your Voice Matters</h2>
<p>International aid and awareness help sustain these programs. By advocating for continued support, people around the world can help ensure UNICEF and similar organizations continue to fund and operate life-saving medical services in Afghanistan.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Healthcare access is a fundamental right, and millions rely on UNICEF’s support to survive.</li>
    <li>A collapse of Afghanistan’s healthcare system could lead to increased mortality rates, disease spread, and worsened humanitarian crises.</li>
    <li>Your support can help sustain and expand these essential services.</li>
