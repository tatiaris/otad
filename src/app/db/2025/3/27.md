<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>A leaked transcript revealed that top Trump administration officials, including the National Security Advisor, the Secretary of Defense, and other senior figures, used the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss a U.S. military strike on Houthi militants in Yemen. The chat, which included The Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg by mistake, contained real-time operational details of the attack, raising concerns about a national security breach.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>The use of an unclassified, commercial messaging app to discuss sensitive military plans violates government security protocols and could have exposed crucial operational details to opponents. The incident has sparked a political controversy, with Democrats calling for resignations and Republicans largely defending the administration.</p>

<h2>Who It Affects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>U.S. Military Personnel:</strong> Operational security lapses can endanger troops.</li>
  <li><strong>American Citizens:</strong> National security breaches could have broad implications for U.S. safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Yemeni Civilians:</strong> The ongoing conflict and airstrikes impact innocent lives.</li>
  <li><strong>Government Officials:</strong> The controversy may lead to investigations and resignations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Your Voice Matters</h2>
<p>Public awareness and pressure can hold government officials accountable for security lapses and transparency in military operations. Whether you support or oppose the administration’s actions, your voice helps shape policy and oversight.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
<p>This issue highlights the importance of cybersecurity, responsible government communication, and oversight of military actions. Ensuring government accountability helps prevent future breaches that could compromise national security.</p>
