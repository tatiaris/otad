One thing you can do today... Support global unity by supporting an international library

<h1>Haskell Free Library Border Policy Change</h1>
    
<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>The U.S. has ended a century-old informal agreement allowing Canadians to enter the Haskell Free Library and Opera House in Vermont without passing through a border checkpoint. This community center sits on both the US and Canadian side of the border. Starting Oct. 1, Canadians without a library card must use a back entrance on the Canadian side. The decision follows concerns over increased illicit activity, including a recent gun-smuggling incident. The library is fundraising to build a sidewalk and improve accessibility on the Canadian side.</p>
    
<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Symbol of International Friendship:</strong> The library represents a peaceful bond between the U.S. and Canada and the change disrupts daily life and relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Precedent for Future Border Policies:</strong> May indicate stricter U.S.-Canada border enforcement.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Burden:</strong> The library must raise $100,000 CAD ($69,000 USD) for infrastructure changes.</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Who It Affects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Local Residents:</strong> Those in Stanstead, Quebec, and Derby Line, Vermont.</li>
  <li><strong>Border Communities:</strong> Other small towns with informal crossings may be impacted.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy Advocates:</strong> Individuals concerned with border security and cross-border relations.</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Why Your Voice Matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Public Pressure Can Influence Policy:</strong> More voices increase chances of policy reconsideration.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for the Library’s Future:</strong> Donations and awareness can help maintain accessibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Democracy in Action:</strong> Citizen engagement shapes border policies.</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cultural and Historical Importance:</strong> The library has symbolized cooperation for over a century and this policy disrupts friendships and traditions..</li>
  <li><strong>Broader Implications:</strong> Could lead to stricter policies elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
