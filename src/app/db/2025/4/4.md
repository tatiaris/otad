<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old father and sheet metal apprentice living in Maryland, was arrested by U.S. immigration agents on March 12 while his 5-year-old autistic son was in the car. He was deported to El Salvador to a maximum security prison (CECOT), even though a 2019 court order had barred his removal due to safety concerns. As a teenager, he fled El Savador to escape gang violence. The Trump administration has admitted this was a mistake—calling it an "administrative error" - but says it does not have the authority to bring him back. Kilmar's family, including his U.S. citizen wife and three children (two of whom are on the autism spectrum), is suing the government to bring him home.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>This case highlights serious flaws in the U.S. immigration system, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The deportation of someone with a legal order allowing him to stay.</li>
  <li>The separation of U.S. citizen children from their parent, including young children with special needs.</li>
  <li>A lack of accountability for government errors with life-altering consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also raises concerns about racial profiling, as Kilmar was originally suspected of gang affiliation (MS-13) based on clothing and a "confidential informant", with little concrete evidence.</p>

<h2>Who It Affects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</strong> – now imprisoned in El Salvador's Terrorisn Confinement Center.</li>
  <li><strong>His family</strong> – a U.S. citizen wife and three young children, left without a father or main provider.</li>
  <li><strong>Latino immigrant communities</strong> – especially those living in fear of wrongful detention or deportation.</li>
  <li><strong>All Americans</strong> – this sets a precedent where lawful orders can be ignored, and families torn apart by error.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Your Voice Matters</h2>
<p>Government systems, especially immigration enforcement, are shaped by public pressure. Without accountability and reform, these errors can continue unchecked. If no one speaks up, similar mistakes will continue to harm more families.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
<p>This is about more than one family. It’s about justice, due process, and how the government treats people who live and work in our communities. If laws and court rulings can be ignored without consequence, no one is safe from similar treatment - especially underrepresented groups.</p>

<h2>Quick Definitions and Explanations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)</strong>: A federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws, including arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants.</li>
  <li><strong>MS-13</strong>: A criminal gang originally from El Salvador, often cited in immigration enforcement. Authorities sometimes use vague or questionable evidence to claim individuals are affiliated.</li>
  <li><strong>CECOT Prison</strong>: A high-security prison in El Salvador known for housing alleged gang members, often under inhumane conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Asylum & Convention Against Torture</strong>: Legal protections for people at risk of torture or harm if sent back to their home country. Kilmar had these protections granted by a judge in 2019.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrative Error</strong>: A government mistake in paperwork or process. In this case, the government admitted to wrongfully deporting Kilmar despite a court order.</li>
</ul>
