<h3>What Happened</h3>
<p>A measles outbreak in western Texas has grown to <strong>505 confirmed cases</strong>, with <strong>24 new infections in the last 5 days</strong>. Most cases are among <strong>unvaccinated children and teens</strong>, with Gaines County being the hardest hit. At least 57 people have been hospitalized, and two unvaccinated children have died. Measles cases have now been reported in <strong>21 states</strong>, and outbreaks are expanding in other areas like Indiana and Colorado.</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>This outbreak signals a serious <strong>public health crisis</strong> stemming from declining vaccination rates. Measles, <strong>once declared eliminated</strong> in the U.S. in 2000, is now making a comeback due to <strong>vaccine hesitancy</strong> and <strong>inadequate immunization coverage</strong>. The disease is <strong>highly contagious</strong> - one of the most contagious viruses known - and preventable with a safe and effective vaccine.</p>

<h3>Who It Affects</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unvaccinated children and adults</strong>, who are at high risk of severe illness and death.</li>
  <li><strong>Infants under 1 year old</strong> who are too young to be vaccinated but can still contract the disease.</li>
  <li><strong>Immunocompromised individuals</strong> who cannot be vaccinated and rely on community immunity.</li>
  <li><strong>Schools and public health systems</strong>, which must respond to outbreaks with limited resources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Your Voice Matters</h3>
<p>You have the power to <strong>influence public policy</strong>, <strong>spread accurate information</strong>, and <strong>protect your community</strong>. Vaccine decisions don't just affect one person - they shape the health and safety of entire populations. Whether you're a parent, teacher, healthcare worker, regular citizen, or student, your advocacy can help <strong>reduce preventable suffering and death</strong>.</p>

<h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
<p>Measles is not just a rash - it's a dangerous disease that can cause <strong>brain damage, pneumonia, blindness, and death</strong>. This outbreak reflects the broader challenge of <strong>trust in science, healthcare equity, and access to accurate information</strong>. Ignoring this issue now could allow more dangerous diseases to return and disrupt everyday life.</p>
