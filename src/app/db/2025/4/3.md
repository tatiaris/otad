One thing you can do today... Protect democracy in California. When decisions are made in the dark, the public loses its voice. The fight for transparency is a fight for democracy itself. 

<h3>What Happened?</h3>
<p>California lawmakers have introduced multiple proposals that would reduce government transparency. These bills would:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make it harder for the public to confront local officials at meetings.</li>
  <li>Allow more government meetings to be held remotely, reducing direct public access.</li>
  <li>Extend the time officials have to disclose campaign donations.</li>
  <li>Weaken public records laws, making it easier for politicians to keep information secret.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, some lawmakers are pushing for more transparency, such as requiring cryptocurrency disclosures and creating an independent office to help citizens access public records.</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Government transparency is a cornerstone of democracy. When officials can make decisions behind closed doors, the public has less power to hold them accountable. Reducing access to financial records, meetings, and public records makes it harder to know who is influencing politicians and what decisions they are making on behalf of the people.</p>

<h3>Who It Affects</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Every Californian:</strong> Reduced transparency means fewer opportunities to hold elected officials accountable.</li>
  <li><strong>Journalists and watchdog groups:</strong> Harder access to records makes investigating corruption and misconduct more difficult.</li>
  <li><strong>Political activists and concerned citizens:</strong> It becomes harder to speak directly to officials and demand action.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Your Voice Matters</h3>
<p>Public pressure has historically helped push lawmakers toward transparency. If enough people speak out against these proposals, it could force lawmakers to reconsider. When citizens actively engage, politicians are more likely to listen and respond to their concerns.</p>

<h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
<p>If politicians can make decisions without oversight, it could lead to policies that benefit their special interests over the public. Transparency ensures fair elections, prevents corruption, and keeps officials accountable to the people they serve. Even if you trust your current representatives, reducing transparency sets a dangerous precedent for the future.</p>
