<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case from South Carolina that could allow states to block public healthcare funds from going to Planned Parenthood, even for non-abortion services like contraception, cancer screenings, and pregnancy testing. The case stems from South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster’s 2018 decision to remove Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funding. While federal law already prohibits Medicaid money from paying for abortions, the case centers on whether Medicaid patients can sue to choose their healthcare providers.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>This case could set a precedent for other states to cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, potentially reducing healthcare access for low-income patients. It could also limit Medicaid patients’ ability to sue for their right to choose their providers, affecting access to various medical services beyond reproductive healthcare.</p>

<h2>Who It Affects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Low-income individuals</strong> who rely on Medicaid for healthcare services.</li>
  <li><strong>Women and reproductive-age individuals</strong> who are looking for general care, or need birth control, cancer screenings, and pregnancy-related care.</li>
  <li><strong>Patients in rural areas</strong> where healthcare options are already limited.</li>
  <li><strong>State Medicaid programs</strong>, which may gain more power to restrict provider access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Your Voice Matters</h2>
<p>Public opinion and advocacy have historically influenced healthcare policy. If this case affects access to care, citizen action can shape legislative responses, funding decisions, and future legal battles.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Healthcare access</strong>: Many rely on Planned Parenthood for basic health services.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal rights</strong>: The case could limit the ability of Medicaid patients to challenge provider restrictions.</li>
  <li><strong>Precedent</strong>: A ruling in favor of South Carolina could encourage other states to follow suit.</li>
</ul>
