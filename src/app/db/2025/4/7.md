<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>Washington D.C.'s interim U.S. Attorney, Ed Martin, announced he is launching investigations into alleged media leaks involving January 6 prosecutions. In an internal email obtained by Reuters, Martin claimed that leaked information damaged the parties involved, including law enforcement officers and witnesses. He also solicited feedback from judges and legal staff on the Justice Department's use of a felony obstruction law—used to charge some of the rioters—that the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/" target="_blank">Supreme Court</a> recently ruled was improperly applied in some cases.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>This investigation and Martin’s conduct raise concerns about the impartiality and independence of the judicial process, especially given Martin’s close ties to Donald Trump, his presence at the Capitol on January 6, and his public alignment with partisan agendas. His nomination to become the permanent U.S. Attorney - pending Senate confirmation by May 20 - could have long-term implications for how justice is administered in politically sensitive cases.</p>

<h2>Who It Affects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Defendants from the January 6 riot cases and their legal outcomes.</li>
  <li>Law enforcement and witnesses who were potentially affected by leaked information.</li>
  <li>Citizens concerned about the fairness of the justice system.</li>
  <li>U.S. Congress members under scrutiny from a politically motivated prosecutor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Your Voice Matters</h2>
<p>This moment isn't just about one prosecutor - it’s about ensuring <strong>transparency, justice, and accountability</strong> in our legal system. Public pressure can influence whether Ed Martin is confirmed, whether ethical standards are upheld, and how future cases involving political violence are prosecuted. Silence allows power to operate unchecked.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
<p>The role of a U.S. Attorney is crucial to upholding the rule of law. When that role is compromised by partisanship or abuse of power, <strong>democracy and justice are at risk</strong>. Whether you support or oppose Martin’s nomination or the ongoing prosecutions, your voice helps shape the integrity of the legal system.</p>
